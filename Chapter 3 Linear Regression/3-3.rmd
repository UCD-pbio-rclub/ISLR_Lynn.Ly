3.6.5 Non-linear transformations

`lm()` can also accomodate non-linear transformations of the predictors. 

The function I() is needed since the ^ has a special meaning in a formula; wrapping as we do allows the standard usage in R, which is to raise X to the power 2.

```{r}
lm.fit2 <- lm(medv~lstat + I(lstat^2), data = Boston)
summary(lm.fit2)

lm(medv ~ lstat + poly(lstat, 5), data = Boston)
```
